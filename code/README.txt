Our code is organized as follow :

-Feature engineering.ipynb : creation of the semantic and topological features for our training and testing data

-Prediction-with-different-classifiers.ipynb : using the features created in the previous Jupyter Notebook, comparison of the performance of different supervised learning algorithms

-Model tuning - LGBM classifier.ipynb : exhaustive model tuning on lightgbm classifier that allowed us to get our best result
